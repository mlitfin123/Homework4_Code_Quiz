# Code_Quiz

This project was done as a part of a homework project for the University of Miami Bootcamp.

The idea of this project is to create a quiz for web developers which allows them to answer questions one at a time and then save their score locally to the web browser.

The project includes just one HTML file which utilizes multiple scripts and hiding and showing various attributes in order to give the feeling that the user is jumping from one screen to the next as they answer questions. My original thought when i got this project was to use one HTML file for each question and start and end screens which would have given the project many different files. After really doing my research I found that it would work but a better approach would be to include everything in the one file.

One of the biggest challenges I have had working on these projects is thinking outside the box to find a simpler way of accomplishing the same task rather than what is straightforward and seems obvious. I feel like this is what it means to think like a programmer and it only gets easier with practice.
